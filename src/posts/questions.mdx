I was recently asked to answer some questions to assist with a college writing course, but I figured
I would share my answers here for others to read as well.

#### 1. What core skill sets, knowledge, or experiences do you feel will best prepare a current college student interested in pursuing work in your field?

When I tell non-technical individuals that I am a software engineer, they often assume that I spend
all day writing code. In reality though, code is just a medium that reflects days of planning & problem
solving that already occurred. With this in mind, a focus on problem solving is critical to an aspiring
software engineer's journey. Before code can be written, the associated problem must be found,
researched, and a potential solution must be designed.

To take a step further, how can we prepare aspiring software engineers to better solve these problems?
The answer is to teach them the _tools_ that allow them to solve different sets of problems. I would
say the most important tools for software engineers would be abstract thinking, generalization, and
an understanding of discrete math.

**Abstract thinking** is "the ability to understand and think with complex concepts that, while real,
are not tied to concrete experiences, objects, people, or situations"[^1]. A fair amount of software
engineering is modeling real world objects and interactions in a way that can be understood by digital
systems. For example, to write self-driving car software, the engineers must first be able to abstract
away the _idea_ of driving a car, and reduce it to the most simplistic questions, procedures, and steps.
This allows them to come up with software implementations of the car that they can then build off of
for their specific use cases.

The next step of abstract thinking in software engineering is to create **generalizations**. In our
car example, we take what was determined to be the essential aspects of what it takes for something
to be a "car" and we create a generalized implementation of it in code. This implementation should be
able to represent a set of cars in a generic way. Students usually trip up when learning generalization
as it involves taking abstract thinking to the next level; its one thing to _reason_ about how something
works, but it's an extra challenge to _create_ an implementation to match that reasoning.

The third important focus, **discrete math**, is what closes the gap between the reasoning and creation
of these implementations. Just about everyone is familiar with _continuous math_, which is what we are
taught in algebra, trig, and calculus; it involves numbers, equations, and infinite values that can be
reasoned or solved for. Discrete math is a different subset of mathematics that involves known items;
for example in a computer, there is only **True** (1) and **False** (0). A computer must do _everything_
using only these two values, which is where [Binary Code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_code) is
derived from. Software engineers must take the entire world and convert their generalized implementations
to use abstractions that build upon these 1s and 0s. Discrete math helps to solve a large swath of problems
across software engineering; there is graph theory, set theory, probability theory, data structures that
build upon discrete math concepts, and functional programing based on discrete proofs.

If an aspiring computer science or software engineer student wants to be successful, I strongly consider
these to be fundamental concepts that they will need to understand.

#### 2. If you were in a position to design a college program from the ground up specifically to prepare students to enter your field, what would you ensure was included (specific training, course content, experiences, etc.)?

I was fortunate enough to help design the next generation of the computer science program at the
University of Buffalo, so this is a pretty easy question to answer!

We attempted to introduce problems and their associated solutions through real world examples. This
made it easier for students to think abstractly to come up with solutions. Previously, students would
be confused and would not be able to draw the relationships between the real world problems and
software implementations.

This focus on practicality also allowed us to introduce programming concepts more gradually through
showing progressively more difficult problems to the students. By starting very simple and working
our way towards more complex problems allowed students to follow along more closely without getting lost.

A major thing that I would push for is **ethics in software**. As tech and software is more integrated
in every facet of our lives, it is important that those writing the code understand the implications
of their decisions and implementations. I feel like this will become more important as time goes on,
especially when considering situations like the effects of social media on mental health, the
environmental effects of cryptocurrency & blockchain solutions, and the real issue of bias being
input into Artificial Intelligence.

#### 3. Were there specific experiences, courses, or content you received in college that helped you succeed in your career?

The biggest thing that helped me get my career off the ground was **getting involved around campus**.
I was a member of the UB ACM chapter (**A**ssociation for **C**omputing **M**achinery) which allowed
me to connect with other students who were interested in computers and technology. This club
introduced me to competing in [hackathons](https://hackathon.guide/), how to
[interview properly](https://dev.to/dan_starner/steps-towards-problem-solving-in-a-technical-interview-41pb),
and helped me to start networking with different companies; one of which being
[Bloomberg](https://www.techatbloomberg.com/) where I interned and worked after college.

The next step in my growth process was to promote from member to leader of ACM, and this occurred
when I was voted in as the Vice President of the club. I learned many lessons in how to lead and
plan strategically, but I also learned a few lessons of how to _not_ lead correctly, which were
just as important.

Apart from ACM, I was also involved with [Blackstone Launchpad at UB](https://www.buffalo.edu/entrepreneurship.html)
and some local Buffalo events, such as [Buffalo's Startup Weekend](https://www.buffalo.edu/innovate/all-resources1.host.html/content/shared/www/innovate/resources/blackstone/buffalo-startup-weekend.detail.html).
Through these different avenues, I was able to meet some incredible people across different backgrounds,
and that would not have happened if I did not get involved.

On the academic side, I also advise taking a class in a topic outside of your comfort zone that
is still in your field of study. I took an introduction to machine learning class that taught me
some really interesting concepts pertaining to machine learning that I can use in my own projects.
It opened some doors and has provided solutions to problems that otherwise would have been more
difficult if I did not have the background provided by that one-off class.


#### 4. Are there specific experiences, training, content you wish you received in college that you think could have helped further your career?

This answer was partially answered by my responses to question 3 and 4, but I will add two additional points that I feel
were subpar;

- I had to find most of the career-growth experiences on my own, and the department did not provide good resources to
  make this discover process easier. Investing in communication, mentoring, and career-growth tools would helps students
  who do not get as connected as I was.
- The University of Buffalo pushed a very theoretical course-load whereas I would have appreciated more practical classes.
  I understand this is for a reason because UB is a research school and my degree was for Computer Science, but it would
  still have been nice to take more classes that had us solving practical problems vs. answering theory & proof questions.
    - This situation _does_ seem to have gotten better since I left, but I'm sure there is always room for more improvement.
 
#### 5. What problems, frustrations, or concerns do you see with recent college graduates entering your field these days?

* Afraid of failure
* afraid of showing weakness
	* don't ask questions when they need to
* overwork themselves to look "productive"
 
#### 6. How important are effective writing skills play in this career? How so?

* design documentation
* strong communication needed via slack & email
* technical writing, blog posts...
