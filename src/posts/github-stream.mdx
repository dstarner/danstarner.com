I had the awesome opportunity to talk about [Heroku](https://heroku.com) on [GitHub Education's Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/githubeducation) last week. We were able to discuss what Heroku is, who can benefit from it, and how to get started as a student!

Watch the video below. Thanks to [Juli√°n Duque](https://twitter.com/julian_duque) for giving me the chance to speak with him about Heroku, and thank's to GitHub & their GitHub Education channel!
